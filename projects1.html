	      When A/B testing multiple versions of a website, it is common to present each version to some constant fraction of users and evaluate performance
	      after some predetermined period of time. However, doing this comes at a cost! Users sent to suboptimal versions of a website have a worse experience and 
	      may generate less revenue. Multi-Armed Bandit testing eliminates much of this cost by adaptively learning which website versions perform best and serving these versions to users more
	      often. 
	      <br><br>
	      I created my own Multi-Armed Bandit website testing framework with Java servlets, AJAX, and JavaScript that learned to serve the best version

	      	This database design was based on business rules laid out in an assignment for CSCI 585, Database Systems. I've included the 
	      	business rules below: 
	      	<br>
	      	<br>
	      	You (a database designer/analyst) have been hired by the owners of a small 'STEM' organization that is interested in offering programming courses in their community, during summer vacation [the classes will be aimed towards high school students who will be on summer break]. 
	      	Rather than offer just "the usual" (Scratch, Java, Python, Ruby...) coding classes, the owners want to make the classes more fun and engaging - they plan on making the classes be centered around microcontrollers. Students will take coding classes, and also work on hands-on projects (each class or project will last a week, the entire curriculum will last 6 weeks) that will have them run their code in a microcontroller (eg. like so).
			Below is what the owners have in mind - if their specifications seem incomplete, you are free (expected, in fact) to make relevant assumptions to help create your design [be sure to document them]. <br><br>
			Students will sign up for a mix of coding classes, and projects. Coding would be taught using Scratch, Processing, Python, Java and JavaScript. Each project would be based on a microcontroller - Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard or micro:bit. Students pay a single flat fee at the beginning, for the entire curriculum.
			<br><br>Instructors (faculty) would teach a variety of coding classes throughout the day, and also oversee projects when they are not teaching. Each coding class has a textbook. An instructor might specify a textbook for more than one class that he/she teaches (eg. the same Python book could be used for Python I and for Python II). A class would have multiple instructors, and each instructor could potentially use a different text (their favorite) for the same class (which those multiple instructors would teach).
			Instructors would get paid based on hours they teach, and hours they supervise projects (the supervision pays a higher rate); all instructors are paid identical rates.
			Projects are done in shared fashion, ie. as a group (typically containing 4 students who all sign up for a common project, eg. a 'Building an arcade game using a Raspberry Pi'). Students would sit around large, square, numbered tables (1,2..) assigned to them, to work on projects; at the start of the term, each table would be provided a big plastic storage box containing all the parts for the project the students will work on; at the end of the term, students will return all the parts presumably in good working order, otherwise they would be charged for damaged items.
			Each project would require parts specific to it - a microcontroller, and extra hardware such as wheels, motors, sensors, LEDs, switches, enclosures, etc.
			<br><br>
			The owners of the institution plan to order project parts from several online suppliers (such as SparkFun, adafruit etc.) - there is expected to be multiple orders placed with multiple vendors, to procure all the items.
			There are several rooms that will be available for the classes and projects - students will be provided a schedule that will list where and when these will be.
			There is a small library that contains books about electronics, coding, etc. A student can check out up to 4 books at a time, which need to be returned in 2 weeks.
			At the end of the curriculum, students will be required to rate their instructors, courses, and projects, using a single score for each (one to five stars).

	      While using a walker may appear simple, proper adjustment and posture is extremely important for the safety of the user. Current walker 
	      designs are unintuitive to use as they do not promote proper posture, allowing users to hunch or slouch while walking which places the user's center of mass dangerously 
	      far forwards where falls can occur. The IntuiStride addresses these problems with a pair of ergonomic arm guides, which serve as a gentle reminder for the user
	      to stand up straight while walking so that their arms comfortably rest on the arm guide foam. In the event of a fall forwards, the arm guides activate a mechanical braking
	      system, which helps to prevent the walker from slipping out in front of the user on low friction surfaces like tile or linoleum.
	      <div id="modal-image-div"><img id="modal-image" src="braking.gif"></div>
	      The arm guides also feature a set of pager motors for silent vibrational tactile cueing. People with Parkinson's disease often suffer from dysrhythmia or freezing 
	      of timed movements. It can be hard for them to establish a rhythmic gait, making mobility challenging. In the event of gait freezing, IntuiStride's pager motors
	      begin vibrating an a rhythmic fashion, which helps the user to establish a safe rhythmic gait.

	      It was a great privilege to learn more about Parkinson's disease from panelists who had been diagnosed with the disease and from professionals who work help treat it.

	      Music Ferret was designed to bring musicians together! My main role within the Music Ferret team was to handle back end and database engineering to 
	      keep track of user profiles. I opted to use a MySQL relational database for this project, and normalized the tables to allow users to play an arbitrary 
	      number of instruments and genres. Queries were performed with embedded SQL in Java. A key design consideration here was backwards compatibility. 
	      We knew when we launched the application that we may want to
	      add or remove instruments and genres from consideration when creating new user profiles. Instrument skill and genre rating tables with foreign keys corresponding 
	      to users allowed us to keep track of user preferences without adding columns to the user profile table, greatly helping with backwards compatibility. 
	      <br><br>
	      A downside of normalization is that it requires us to use joins to find an individual user's preferences. This may not be ideal as our application scales, and 
	      we might choose to denormalize. Additionally, it would be beneficial to implement our matchmaking algorithm with embedded SQL rather than loading the whole database
	      into memory for matchmaking. First of all, this would allow us to match users even when we have more users than would fit in memory. Second, this would allow
	      us to take advantage of DBMS optimizations. 
	      <br><br>
	      Along with the web app itself, our group produced a full suite of tests and documentation for our project. 
	      <br><br>
	      I've added a small snippet of code I developed for this app on my GitHub. You can view it <a href="https://github.com/seanmcneely/Coursework/tree/master/MusicFerret">here!</a>
